Input file:
    (as given in problem statement)
- needs to be named 'inp.txt'
- It contains N, K, rowInc (space or newline seperated in this same order)
- after that the matrix A in row major order
- needs spaces or newline between values



Executing:
- g++ Assgn3_Src-CS22BTECH11061.cpp
- ./a.out
- we get the output files



Output Files:
- one output file for each Algorithm(TAS, CAS, BCAS, Atomic Increment)
- named out_tas.txt, out_cas.txt, out_bcas.txt, out_atomic_increment.txt
- each output file consists of 
    - Total Time taken(Total execution time in micro seconds)
    - Square of Matrix A
