Set-Associative Cache Memory Simulation with Java


Description:
	This program simulates a set-associative cache memory based on the provided trace file. It calculates cache hits, cache misses, set-wise total misses, and set-wise total hits for each run.



Zip file includes:
1. cacheSimulation.java (The program to simulate cache memory)
2. Three trace files which have address in Hexadecimal format.



Usage:
1. Download the source code files.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Compile the Java source files using the following command:
->	javac cacheSimulation.java	

4. Run the program with the required command line arguments:
->	java cacheSimulation <Cache size> <Associativity> <Block Size> <Trace file path>

5. The program will simulate the set-associative cache memory based on the provided trace file and display the results.




Simulation Results:
The simulation results include the following information for each run:
	- Set-wise total misses
        - Set-wise total hits
        - Total cache hits
        - Total cache misses
	


Trace file conditions:
	1. Addresses must be seperated by space or a new line.
	2. Needs Address in Hexadecimal format.
