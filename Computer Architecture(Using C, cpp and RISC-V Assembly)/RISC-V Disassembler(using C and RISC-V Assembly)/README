This program Supports all the instructions given till part-4(last part) as well as labelling.
Work for all parts is completed.
Hence the work for whole 100% weightage has been done(including report).


Steps to run -
  I) Go to the folder where the zip file is extracted to.
 II) Run following commands on the terminal 
    1. gcc disassembler.c
    2. ./a.out
III) Enter the input file name.

We get the output.

Note: An input file which consists all the asked instructions(also instructions which need label) is provided.
      Its test values where all checked to be correct.


Input file conditions:
1)  Instruction should be present in hexadecimal(exactly 8 characters)
    (works with or without '0x' prefix)

2)  hexadecimal instruction must have 8 characters or digits.
    (input cannot be 'FFFF'(not allowed) instead of '0000FFFF'(allowed))

3)  Each instruction should be written on seperate line.

4)  If first character of line is ' '(space) or '\n'(i.e. newline) or '\t'(i.e. tab) then this line is ignored in the program.

Important: It is assumed that instructions are from the ones given in problem statement.
